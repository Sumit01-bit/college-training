    "# is a method to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. The equation of the line is represented as y = mx + c, where m is the slope and c is the y-intercept. The goal is to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the difference between the predicted values and the actual data points.\n",
